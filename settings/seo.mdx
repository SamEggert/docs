The platform automatically generates most meta tags.

However, you can fully customize them by adding the [metadata](/core-concepts/settings#param-metadata) field to your `docs.json` or the page's frontmatter.

## Global meta tags

You can set default meta tags by adding the `metadata` field to your `docs.json`.

```json
"seo": {
    "metatags": {
        "og:image": "link to your default meta tag image"
    }
}
```

## Page-specific meta tags

Add your meta tags to the page's metadata like so:

```md
---
title: 'Your Example Page Title'
'og:image': 'link to your meta tag image'
---
```

<Warning>
  Meta tags with colons need to be typed with quotes around them when you put them in the page metadata.
</Warning>

## Sitemaps

Mintlify automatically generates a `sitemap.xml` file and a `robots.txt` file. Simply navigate to `/sitemap.xml` to see your sitemap.

Only pages included in your `docs.json` are included by default. To include hidden links, add `seo.indexing` to your `docs.json`:

```json
"seo": {
    "indexing": all
}
```

## Disabling indexing

If you want to stop a page from being indexed by search engines, you can include the following in the [frontmatter](/core-concepts/pages) of your page:

```
---
noindex: true
---
```

You can also specify `noindex` for all pages in your docs by setting the `metadata.robots` field to `"noindex"` in your `docs.json`:

```json
"seo": {
    "metatags": {
      "robots": "noindex"
    }
  }
```
